# Hunt Your Own National Treasure

#### A Choose Your Own Adventure Game inspired by the cinematic masterpiece _National Treasure_ (2004)



> "Ben, you can't steal the Declaration of Independence. It's like stealing a national monument...not that it _can't_ be done - but it ***_shouldn't_*** be done."

Your name is Benjamin Franklin Gates, you are the last of a line of discgraced treasure hunters, and you are determined to find the infamous Knights Templar Treasure that your grandfather told you about as a kid. You have put together a team: your trusty tech buddy Riley Poole, your benefactor Ian, and Ian's group of henchmen. Together, you're going to find the treasure and redeem your family's name.

But to find a treasure, you need a map. And what better place for the map to be hidden than on the back of the Declaration of Independence? But you can't exactly...borrow it.

The goal of this game is to successfully steal the Declaration of Independence. As you move through the story, you will be presented with a decision to make and two option buttons to choose from. Each time you click an option button, you will advance the story into a new scene in your own unique adventure. Choose wisely, and your hunt will end in success! Choose poorly, and the fate of your hunt could be ruinous.

If you don't like how your hunt is going and you regret some of your choices, click the Restart button under title to start fresh at the starting decision with a new hunt.

## Ice Box ðŸ§Š
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Light/Dark Mode
- [ ] Fun cursor
- [ ] Intro sequence (model after Christopher Plummer scene) summarizing the lore of the National Treasure and intro-ing you to where you are at the beginning of the story 
  - [ ] With animations
- [ ] Pre-Main Menu screen animation
  - [ ] Image of all-seeing eye (holographic, transparent) slowly blinking/fading in and out on opening screen, something clearly clickable (â€˜startâ€™ or â€˜openâ€™ as a placeholder) clearly indicating to the player that when they click they will be taken to a start/main menu screen
- [ ] Start/Main Menu screen that loads before game starts, containing the game title, an image, and a button to click to start the game. Also leaves room in the display for more buttons to be added as icebox features are added.
- [ ] Ability for user to save and load unfinished games
  - [ ] Would add Load Game button to main menu that, when clicked, renders a message to the user to click on on the save file they want to load, and 3 clickable containers that correspond to up to 3 different save files
  - [ ] Potentially add ability to save even more than 3 files
- [ ] Toggle sound on/off button
- [ ] Cheat code features (player loads game and types out a code before clicking anything)
  - [ ] Accurate DC Traffic Laws Mode
  - [ ] Confetti Mode
  - [ ] Romantic Tension Mode (would still be 2000â€™s Disney PG rated)
  - [ ] Sean Bean Mode (player swaps characters and plays through the game as Sean Beanâ€™s character, Ian)
    - [ ] This icebox feature is extra icy - obviously a large undertaking bc it will essentially mean rewriting a second version of the game, but from Ianâ€™s POV
- [ ] Computer player
  - [ ] Computer controls Sean Bean, computerâ€™s decisions can both positively and negatively affect the playerâ€™s chances of winning
- [ ] Flesh out dialogue and extra bits of story that the player can click through and read between Decision Points in the game
  - [ ] Extra Icy: animations when clicking through back-and-forth dialogue between two characters, eg. speaker is more pronounced/in foreground, listener is less pronounced/slightly greyed out/closer to background
- [ ] Extended story:
  - [ ] Initial game will only be the story up through Ben initially stealing the Declaration from the National Archives
  - [ ] Want to add an option for the player to continue the story after the Archives plot ends, leading them through the rest of the plot of the movie where the player will:
    - [ ] Decide if/when to tell Benâ€™s father that he stole the Declaration
    - [ ] Travel from DC to Philadelphia and NYC while continuing to protect the Declaration from Ian, run from the FBI, and find more clues to the treasure
    - [ ] Find the treasure and decide what to do with it! (If you can escape the underground caverns where itâ€™s hidden!)
- [ ] Player settings button - renders container with message + menu of buttons the user can click to:
  - Adjust sound volume
  - Save game
  - Start Over
  - Return to menu
  - [ ] If Settings button can be built in, additional goal would be to only keep these buttons in a Settings menu, and no longer render them individually on screen while the game is being played
